        <h4>While a member of the military is on active duty, there are programs in place to help his or her immediate family (spouse and dependent children). In most cases, they can live on the base with the soldier (in the case of the Army). This depends on a few factors, including what unit the military member is with, what their military occupational specialty (MOS) is, and their deployment status.So sticking with the Army example, if a soldier is single, he or she can live in barracks on the base, but a soldier with a family may live in base housing. </h4>

        <h4>Soldiers on active duty can be deployed anytime, for a period of 12 consecutive months.For soldiers on active duty, service terms typically last between two and six years, depending on the unit and its mission. Soldiers are eligible for a two weeks of leave after six months of deployment.This varies depending on the branch of the service. In the Marines, the most common enlistment contracts include four or five years of active duty service. In the Air Force, most airmen enlist for a total of eight years of active duty.</h4>
